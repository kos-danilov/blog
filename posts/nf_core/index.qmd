If you have a common task for NGS data processing - check this out.

In most cases with common data types and analyses, you don't need to create a workflow from scratch. The Nextflow community has created many pipelines that are highly reproducible, versioned, and utilize containers or Conda environments:

::: {.callout-tip}
You can ensure reproducibility by using a specific version of the pipeline. While there is sometimes limited flexibility in the tool parameters, you can address this by editing specific modules of the pipelines locally.
:::

To configure the pipeline, you should consult the webpage of the corresponding workflow. However, in general, a few key items need to be set up before starting:

- Pipeline and version
- Configuration profile for your executor
- Workflow parameters (including input tables, etc.)

::: {.callout-important}
These pipelines are the result of countless hours of open-source work and collaboration, so always remember to cite them properly.
